2D Soccer
This paper describes main skills of TwinTeam 2D soccer simulation team (2010).
In this paper we describe our works including both the algorithms extending imperfect already existing modules such as block and some newly added modules such as dribble system.

Algorithms are described in the "TWINTEAM.pdf"
